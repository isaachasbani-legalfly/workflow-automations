# Changelog

All notable changes to the HubSpot Company Industry Categorization workflow will be documented in this file.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed - $helpers not available in n8n task runner

**Error**: `ReferenceError: $helpers is not defined` — n8n's external task runner does not expose `$helpers` to Code nodes.

**Fix**: Replaced the single "Get Today's Companies" Code node with two nodes:
1. **HTTP Request "Search Today's Companies"** — calls `POST /crm/v3/objects/companies/search` with `createdate >= today_midnight_UTC` filter using the `hubspotAppToken` predefined credential
2. **Code "Split Companies"** — splits `$json.results` array into individual `{id, properties}` items

**Flow**:
```
Schedule Trigger → Search Today's Companies (HTTP Request) → Split Companies (Code) → Check Demo Form
```

## [3.2.0] - 2026-02-16

### Refactor - Replace polling node with HubSpot Search API (efficient date filtering)

**Problem**: `getRecentlyCreatedUpdated` with `returnAll: true` retrieves every company ever created and filters in n8n — extremely inefficient.

**Solution**: Replaced the HubSpot poll node + Normalize Code node with a single "Get Today's Companies" Code node that:
- Calls `POST /crm/v3/objects/companies/search` with `createdate >= today_midnight_UTC`
- Filters happen at the HubSpot API level — only today's companies are returned
- Handles pagination automatically (loops through pages of 100)
- Returns `{id, properties}` in v3 flat format directly — no normalization needed

**Flow change**:
```
Before: Schedule Trigger → Get Recent Companies (HubSpot) → Normalize & Filter New (Code) → Check Demo Form
After:  Schedule Trigger → Get Today's Companies (Code)                                   → Check Demo Form
```

**Nodes removed**: Get Recent Companies (HubSpot `getRecentlyCreatedUpdated`)
**Nodes merged**: "Normalize & Filter New" replaced by "Get Today's Companies"

**Workflow ID**: `8DM3CwXLxOT3G8B7`

## [3.1.6] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed - Use returnAll to guarantee all today's companies are fetched

**Problem**: `limit: 100` would miss companies if more than 100 were added today.

**Fix**: Changed to `returnAll: true` — HubSpot node paginates through all recently created companies; the Normalize node then filters down to only those with `createdate` = today.

**Workflow ID**: `8DM3CwXLxOT3G8B7`

---

## [3.1.5] - 2026-02-16

### Changed - Fetch All Companies Added Today (not just uncategorized)

**Previous behavior**: Only fetched companies missing `industry__internal_` (uncategorized)
**New behavior**: Fetches all companies added today — including already-categorized ones — so existing categories can be improved/corrected

**Changes**:
- Removed `industry__internal_` `NOT_HAS_PROPERTY` filter from Get Recent Companies node
- Increased limit from 10 → 100 to handle larger daily volumes
- Renamed node from "Get Uncategorized Companies" → "Get Recent Companies"
- Normalize node still filters to today's `createdate` only

**Workflow ID**: `8DM3CwXLxOT3G8B7`

## [3.1.4] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed - Three Additional Issues

**1. Get Uncategorized Companies filter lost**
- Partial update to the Normalize node inadvertently stripped the `industry__internal_` `NOT_HAS_PROPERTY` filter
- Restored: workflow now only fetches companies without `industry__internal_` set

**2. Check Demo Form leftValue simplified**
- Removed the `typeof` ternary expression (unnecessary after Normalize guarantees strings)
- New expression: `={{ $json.properties.industry__form____contact_sync || '' }}`

**3. Check Website Success leftValue wrong type**
- Was `={{ $json }}` — passes entire JSON object to string `contains` operator → "Wrong type: [object Object]" error
- Fixed to `={{ $json.data || '' }}` — accesses the HTML body string from the HTTP response

## [3.1.3] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed - IF Node Object Type Error & Time Filter Change

**Issues**:
1. `Check Demo Form` still throwing "Wrong type: '[object Object]' is an object but was expecting a string" — the previous normalization only handled `{value: "..."}` format, leaving other object shapes as-is
2. Time filter was "last 25 hours" instead of "companies added today"

**Fixes** (both in "Normalize & Filter New" Code node):
- **Stronger normalization**: ALL property values are now converted to strings. Any `null`/`undefined` → `''`, any object → `String(val.value)` or `''`, primitives → `String(val)`. This guarantees downstream IF nodes always receive strings.
- **Today filter**: Changed from `Date.now() - 25h` rolling window to `Date.UTC` midnight of current day, so companies added at any point today are included regardless of when the workflow runs.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed - HubSpot v2 API companyId Mismatch & Retroactive Processing

**Root Cause**: `getRecentlyCreatedUpdated` uses the legacy HubSpot v2 API which:
- Returns `companyId` (not `id`) as the identifier field
- Returns properties in nested `{value: "..."}` format instead of flat strings
- This caused `$json.id` to be `undefined`, triggering 400 errors in "Get Company Details"

**Additional Fix**: Workflow previously had no time filter, meaning it would retroactively process all 3,511 existing uncategorized companies. Added a 25-hour rolling window so only companies created since the last run are processed.

**Fix Applied**: Added "Normalize & Filter New" Code node between "Get Uncategorized Companies" and "Check Demo Form":
- Remaps `companyId` → `id` (fixes v2 API field name mismatch)
- Filters out companies older than 25 hours (prevents retroactive processing)
- Normalizes nested v2 property format `{value: "..."}` to flat strings

**Also Fixed in this session**:
- `Check Demo Form` IF node: added `typeof` check to handle object-type property values (prevents "Wrong type: '[object Object]'" error)
- HubSpot property name corrected: `industry_internal_sync` → `industry__internal_` (actual property name in HubSpot)

**Workflow ID**: `8DM3CwXLxOT3G8B7`

## [3.1.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed - HTTP Request Node "Not Installed" Error

**Root Cause**: The three HTTP Request nodes (`LinkedIn Enrichment`, `Website Scraping`, `Online Research`) were deployed with `typeVersion: 4.4`, which is not supported by the n8n cloud instance. This caused:
- UI: "Install this node to use it" / "This node is not currently installed"
- Runtime: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'execute')`

**Fix Applied (via n8n MCP)**:
- Downgraded all three HTTP Request nodes from `typeVersion: 4.4` → `typeVersion: 4.2`
- Cleaned up `LinkedIn Enrichment` body params: replaced `specifyBody: "json"` with `contentType: "json"` and `body` expression
- Updated `Website Scraping` and `Online Research` expressions to use `$('Node Name').item.json` syntax

**Nodes Fixed**:
| Node | Change |
|------|--------|
| LinkedIn Enrichment | typeVersion 4.4 → 4.2, specifyBody → contentType |
| Website Scraping | typeVersion 4.4 → 4.2 |
| Online Research | typeVersion 4.4 → 4.2 |
